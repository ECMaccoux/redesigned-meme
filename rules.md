# X-Team 10 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We'll assign tasks on a volunteer basis first and then divy up the rest
based on the amount of work that each person is already doing, keeping things balanced.

## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Progress will be tracked through gitHub, WhatsApp, and in-person meetings when necessary.


## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

* All the team member will gather together, discuss the difficult parts and exchange ideas. 
* Focus on only one problem a time, and then another, until everything is solved


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

* Each team member will send out a status report to others after a change / update is made
* Status report will include details of a particular task assigned to that person:
        * What is done / changed?
        * What needs to be done?

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
1. Always communicate over WhatsApp with what has been/needs to be done
2. We should have weekly meetings to touch base and talk about difficult problems that we need ot solve.
